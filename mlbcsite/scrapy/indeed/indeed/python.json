{"job_spec": ["Python Instructor job - Coding Temple - Boston, MA | Indeed.com"], "job_title": ["Python Instructor"], "job_desc": "  If you live and breathe code as your craft and find joy in helping other people learn, Coding Temple is an ideal fit for you.   What we believe in:    First and most importantly, here are a few of our values when it comes to teaching someone how to be a developer:   Problem solving over syntax - We believe syntax is the easy part of programming, whereas learning to think like an engineer is one of the most important skills we can teach.    Quality over quantity \u2013 We\u2019re interested in training true professionals, not getting as many people into our classes as possible. We emphasize small class sizes and value personal interactions with students.    Real projects over tests \u2013 People learn programming best by tackling hard problems with a mentor, not following a list of steps or taking a quiz.    Emphasis on open source \u2013 We deeply value the open source mindset and teach our students the importance of using and contributing to the open source ecosystem.    What the role and responsibilities look like:    As an instructor, you will serve as a lecturer and mentors to our students, helping them learn to think like engineers and hone their skills as a programmer. Our courses do not replace a Computer Science degree, but as an instructor, it is your job to ensure students know enough to compete in the job market. You\u2019ll also help refine the curriculum to stay current with emerging tools and technology. Our maximum class size is 10 students, and there are additional staff members on-hand to assist with the running the program. Outside of class, you\u2019re expected to be an active part of the development community in your city (hopefully you already are), and you may be required to act as a spokesperson for Coding Temple\u2019s programs at events.   Requirements    Your qualities and experience:     Self-starter who takes ownership of your role    2+ years of professional web development experience    Written and verbal communication skills.    Knowledge and experience with Python and JavaScript    Knowledge of Object Oriented Design concepts    Knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms.    Experience with Django or other Python web framework.    Experience with MySql, PostgreSQL, or other data management system.    Comfortable leading fluid discussions: the ability to work off of the scripted lecture to give dynamic, real world examples.    Experience working in a project management framework.    High level of empathy and patience when working with students.    Open and honest communication with staff and students    You are capable of offering career guidance based on your own experiences and observations.    Compensation and benefits    Competitive full-time salary    Relaxed working environment (casual attire, free food, ping-pong table)    A one-week \u201cbreak\u201d between each ten-week course (can be used for Paid Time Off or professional development), up to two weeks of additional Paid Time Off.
