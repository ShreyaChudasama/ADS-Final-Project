          <p>MBC is Web based platform for candidates who are seeking a job and recruiter who are looking for the right talent. The platform ​scrapes and analyzes publicly available job posting data from sites like Glassdoor, LinkedIn, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
           The system will recommend the candidate which jobtitlewill fit him/her based on their resume. The system will also give job links to the application form.The platform will also help us to gain statistical information about the latest job trend.

<b>Overview</b><br><ul>
<li>Automatic user localization consists of estimating the position of the user (latitude, longitude and altitude) by using an electronic device, usually a mobile phone. Outdoor localization problem can be solved very accurately thanks to the inclusion of GPS sensors into the mobile devices. However, indoor localization is still an open problem mainly due to the loss of GPS signal in indoor environments. With the widespread use of Wi-Fi communication in indoor environments, Wi-Fi or wireless local area network (WLAN) based positioning gained popularity to solve indoor localization.</li>
<li>WLAN-based positioning systems utilize the Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) value. In this project, we focus on fingerprint-based localization. Fingerprinting technique consists of two phases: calibration and positioning. In the calibration phase, an extensive radio map is built consisting of RSSI values from multiple Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) at different knownlocations. This calibration data is used to train the localization algorithm. In the positioning phase, when a user reports the RSSI measurements for the multiple APs, the fit algorithm predicts the user position.</li>
<li>
A key challenge in wireless localization is that RSSI value at a given location can have large fluctuations due to Wi-Fi interference, user mobility, environmental mobility etc. In this project, we design, implement and evaluate machine learning algorithms for WLAN fingerprint-based localization.
